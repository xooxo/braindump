A way of injecting an entire portable executabe (PE) into another running process.

High level process of the technique as used in this lab:
    Parse the currently running image's PE headers and get its sizeOfImage
    Allocate a block of memory (size of PE image retrieved in step 1) in the currently running process. Let's call it localImage
    Copy the image of the current process into the newly allocated local memory
    Allocate new memory block (size of PE image retrieved in step 1) in a remote process - the target process we want to inject the currently running PE into. Let's call it targetImage
    Calculate delta between memory addresses localImage and targetImage
    Patch the PE you're injecting or, in other words, relocate it/rebase it to targetImage. For more information about image relocations, see my other lab T1093: Process Hollowing and Portable Executable Relocations
    Write the patched PE into targetImage memory location
    Create remote thread and point it to InjectionEntryPoint function inside the PE
